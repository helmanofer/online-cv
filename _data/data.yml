      I am an experienced data and ML engineer with over 10 years of experience architecting, designing, and developing large-scale data pipelines, machine learning systems, and search engines. I am currently a Data and ML Tech Lead at Kaltura, leading the development of LLM-based products.
      I have previously worked in various data engineering and machine learning roles at the Israeli Government, Revuze, Kaminario, and NICE Systems. I built an internal search engine using Solr and NLP at the Israeli Government. At Revuze, I established and led the algorithm development team to create core NLP and machine learning products for analyzing customer reviews.
      On the tech side, I have extensive experience with Python, Java, Scala, Spark, Kafka, Solr, Elasticsearch, AWS services, Airflow, and more. I hold a BSc in Electronics and Computer Engineering (graduated with honors) and an MBA focused on Information Systems (graduated with honors).
      I have led multiple teams and projects over my career. I am skilled at architecting, implementing, and deploying end-to-end machine learning and data solutions.
